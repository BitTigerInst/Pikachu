Description

Our goal is to build a system that discover interesting facts from web data. The system consist of three major components, including web crawler, exploratory analysis, and data visualization.


Plan

Based on our experiences on web development and data science, as well as the descriptions mentioned above, we take _Feb, 2016_ as the __1st stage__ with the __primary__ goal of __prototyping__ our application following the development guild lines mentioned below. Here's the tentative timeline.

* __[2016/02/08 - 2016/02/12]__ Project Selection, Plan Discussion, Proposal Draft Writing, Resource Discovery
* __[2016/02/13 - 2016/03/07]__ System Design, Project Implementation
    * Web Crawler
    * Exploratory Analyzer / Recommender
    * Data Visualization
* __[2016/03/08 - 2016/03/15]__ Document Writing, User Manual Writing and Video Presentation Making

_Details of each schedule and task will be added later._

Development Guild Lines
-----------------------

- __Modularity.__ Following the principle _"loose coupling and high cohesion"_, each module should be standalone.
- __Minimalism.__ Each module should be kept short, simple, and concise. Every piece of code should be transparent upon first reading.
- __Easy extensibility.__ New modules (as new classes and functions) are should be simply add, and existing modules should be extended easily.
