Description
-----------

Our goal is to build a system that discover interesting facts from web data. The system consist of three major components, including web crawler, exploratory analysis, and data visualization.


Plan
----

Based on our experiences on web development and data science, as well as the descriptions mentioned above, we take _Feb, 2016_ as the __1st stage__ with the __primary__ goal of __prototyping__ our application following the development guild lines mentioned below. Here's the tentative timeline.

* __[2016/02/08 - 2016/02/12]__ Project Selection, Plan Discussion, Proposal Draft Writing, Resource Discovery
* __[2016/02/13 - 2016/03/07]__ System Design, Project Implementation
    * Web Crawler
    * Exploratory Analyzer / Recommender
    * Data Visualization
* __[2016/03/08 - 2016/03/15]__ Document Writing, User Manual Writing and Video Presentation Making

_Details of each schedule and task will be added later._

Language & Framework & Tech Stack
--------------------

+ Javascript: Node.js, Express.js, AngularJS
+ Database: MongoDB
+ Cloud Platform: Cloud Foundry


Development Guild Lines
-----------------------

- __Modularity.__ Following the principle _"loose coupling and high cohesion"_, each module should be standalone.
- __Minimalism.__ Each module should be kept short, simple, and concise. Every piece of code should be transparent upon first reading.
- __Easy extensibility.__ New modules (as new classes and functions) are should be simply add, and existing modules should be extended easily.
